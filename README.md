Don't want to use Alt+Tab when you want to pause/play rewind/forward the video tutorial you are watching from YouTube (any video sites)  while actively typing your code, editing a photo/video?

This extension will let you control video player in the comfort of your productivity app (IDE, text editor, video editor, Photoshop etc)

To use, after installing the extension, paste this in Chrome:

```
chrome://extensions/shortcuts#:~:text=No%20AltTab%20Video
```

Then set your own hotkey for these actions:

Don't forget to change the dropdown from Chrome to Global, otherwise the hotkeys won't work when the active app is not Chrome (e.g., your IDE or text editor)
