This extension will let you control YouTube in the comfort of your favorite IDE or code editor

To use, after installing the extension, paste this in Chrome:

```
chrome://extensions/shortcuts#:~:text=NoSwitch%20for%20YouTube
```

Then set your own shortcut for these actions:

Don't forget to change the dropdown from Chrome to Global, otherwise the hotkeys won't work
