Don't want to use Alt+Tab when you want to pause/play rewind/forward the YouTube video tutorial you are watching while actively typing your code?

This extension will let you control YouTube in the comfort of your favorite IDE or code editor

To use, after installing the extension, paste this in Chrome:

```
chrome://extensions/shortcuts#:~:text=No%20AltTab%20Video
```

Then set your own hotkey for these actions:

Don't forget to change the dropdown from Chrome to Global, otherwise the hotkeys won't work when the active app is not Chrome (e.g., your IDE or text editor)
